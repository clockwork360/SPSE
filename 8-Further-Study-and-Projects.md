Where do we go from here? 

Mantra to be a Good Programmer

	• Code! Code and more Code! 
	• Read and learn from other people's code
	• Rip apart interesting open source tools in Python 

New Packages 

	• Python.org is a definitive resource
	• Keep visiting sites like SourceForge, Github for Python projects
	• Any new tool release - check if Python code 
		○ Rip it apart and add functionality 
		○ Do not re-invent the whell 

SPSE Projects

	• To Code is to Create
	• Choose an idea based on the different domains we have covered
	• Create a project in Github
	• Try and Push your limits and choose something BIG! :) 
	• Complete and post projects link to the student forums

Project Idea #1

	• Create a Bot which can use Twitter as C&C
	• It will scan the public tweets using a #tag and a command will be inserted in the Tweet
	• e.g. Tweet

	#exec129834 ipconfig -a 
	
	The bot will now execute "ipconfig -a" and paste the results in Pastebin 

Project Idea #2 

	• Create a automated Email Parser - when email is received in your account, this script will automatically be triggered, it will then seperate the attachments, store them in a directly and upload them to online virus scan sites. 
	• It will then forward the email to you if the online scans give a green signal!! 

Project Idea #3

	• Code a program which can read an EXE and dump interesting information such as imports/exports, disassembly, strings etc. 
	• Basically a powerful Level  1 binary analysis tool before you put the EXE into a debugger 

Conclusion

	• Start thinking out of the box 
	• Try and automate any task you do repeatedly
	• Get into the habit of coding quick PoCs for fun and professional use 
	• Code! Code! Code!
